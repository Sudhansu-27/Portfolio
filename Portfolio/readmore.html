        <h1> <u> HOUSE RENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM </u></h1>

            <h3><u>Introduction :</u> </h3>

            House Rental Management has become important factor in modern society. Housing has a central importance to
            quality of life with considerable economic, social, cultural and personal significance.Though a country’s 
            national prosperity is usually measured in economic terms, increasing wealth is of diminished value unless all
            can share its benefits and if the growing wealth is not used to redress growing social deficiencies, one of
            which is housing.
            
            Housing plays a huge role in revitalizing economic growth in any country, with shelter being among key
            indicators of development. The universal declaration of human rights gives one of the basic human rights 
            as the right to a decent standard of living, central to which is the access to adequate housing. 
            
            Housing as a basic human right demands that urban dwellers should have access to a decent housing, defined as 
            one that provides a foundation for rather than being a barrier to good physical and mental health, 
            personal development and fulfillment of life objectives. The focus of this research paper is
            basically managing housing for low income, medium and high incomes households or what is commonly known as 
            affordable housing.

            “Affordable” is a term used to describe individuals “capability to pay for certain products or services because 
            their income is enough to do so.Although the term “affordable housing” is often applied to rental housing; 
            that is within the financial means of those in the lower income ranges of a geographical area, the concept is 
            applicable to both middle and high income individuals.

            Developing rental houses comes with many advantages especially to the Landlords who are able to increase their 
            profits through rent paid by the tenants. Increased number of tenants and Landlords makes management difficult 
            especially for the landlords who are losing huge sum of money through tenants who evade rent. 
            
            The above statement gives a clear declaration as to why rental house management system need to be developed.

            <h3><u>Background of the study :</u></h3>

            Over the years landlords/property managers have had a problem in maintaining and managing their customers and their own 
            records. Management has become difficult because of the issues that include: 

            i. Data growth: Data increase day to day. Storing and maintaining all data manually is very difficult lack of computerized 
            system: Currently most landlords/property managers use the manual system in recording and maintaining their property and 
            customers data.

            ii. Data security is not assured: In a manual way, data is recorded on books/papers which may easily get damaged leading 
            to loss of data.

            iii. There is no database to store information: Potential of data loss or damage is very high because data is stored on 
            tangible files.

            iv. Human resource: The current system has too much manual work from filling a form to filing a document, delivering 
            manifesto. This increases burden on workers but does not yield the results it should.

            v. Thorny Job: In current system if any modification is to be made it increases manual work and is error prone. 

            vi. Error: As the system is managed and maintained by workers errors are some of the possibilities. Lack of these  
            crucial requirements makes management of the tenants and houses very difficult as some tenants may end up not paying 
            rent.
            
            <h3><u>Advantages :</u></h3>

            i. The System Which Will allow the user to quickly and easily search a property for buy and Sell.
            ii. The register user can upload his property for sale or rent out.
            iii. The System is design and developed in such way that it tries to overcome all the prescribe problem.
            iv. The system being an online system will give accurate information regarding the property which helps to view all the 
                 stuff information directly from anywhere.

            <h3><u>Conclusion and future work :</u></h3>

            Future Work- We provide the user with drop
